Hello everyone,

I'm Niklas Brandtner, and I'm very excited to be part of this course this semester.

Let me tell you a bit about myself:

For the past five years, I've been studying information technology at TGM Wien. During my time there, I learned a lot about computer science, programming, web design, and even technical English, thanks to our IT-focused teachers. Some of them recommended FH Technikum, which piqued my interest.

The reason I chose to study here is quite simple: I heard great things about FH Technikum from my old school teachers, and since I wanted to pursue a career in information technology, it seemed like the right choice.

What really grabs my attention in the IT world right now is IT-Security and Data Science & Statistics. Both fields offer promising job opportunities, and they're just plain interesting. I like to dabble in them during my free time, whether it's while playing games or working on personal projects. I'm especially intrigued by how we can use data science and cybersecurity together for threat detection and analysis.

On a more personal note, something unusual about me is my fascination with the ocean and deep water. Whenever I'm near the sea, I love to go scuba-diving and free-diving. What really gets my heart racing are cave dives and exploring sunken wrecks, which add that extra thrill and adventure to the experience.

As we dive into this semester together, I'm looking forward to learning, growing, and connecting with all of you. Let's explore the world of technology and beyond!
