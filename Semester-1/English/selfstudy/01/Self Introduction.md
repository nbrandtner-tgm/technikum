Hello everyone,

I'm Niklas Brandtner, I'm 20 years old and very excited to be part of this course this semester.

Let me tell you a bit about myself:

For the past five years, I've been studying information technology at TGM Wien. During my time there, I learned a lot about computer science, programming, web design, and also technical english, thanks to our dedicated teachers. A few of those teachers were at FH Technikum themselves, and since i wanted to visit a Fachhochschule anyway, the FH Technikum in particular piqued my interest.

What really grabs my attention in the IT world right now is IT-Security and Data Science & Statistics. Both fields offer promising job opportunities, and they're just plain interesting. My plan in the future is to finish the FH Technikum with a Masters and then find a career path that lets me further develop my skills in these topics. I also like to dabble in them during my free time, whether it's while playing games or working on personal projects. I'm especially intrigued by how we can use data science and cybersecurity together for threat detection and analysis.

On a more personal note, something unusual about me is my fascination with the ocean and deep water. Whenever I'm near the sea, I love to go scuba-diving and free-diving. What really gets my heart racing are cave dives and exploring sunken wrecks, which add that extra thrill and adventure to the experience.
