1. **Do you consider yourself to be an effective writer in English? What about in your first language?**
   1. I consider myself a decently efficient and effective writer in English since I spend most of my time at home speaking or typing in English with friends abroad.
2. **How important do you think is good spelling and grammar for quality writing?**
   1. It always depends on the context, a text can be qualitive but in a non formal context. But good spelling and grammar definitely shows professionalism, capability and of course improves the quality of a text.
3. **What mistakes do you think people make when trying to write texts in English?**
   1. I think the most basic mistakes people whose first language was not English, is that they stick to the same few words and don't properly use all of their vocabulary.
4. **What are the key features of good writing according to the text?**
   1. The key features of good writing include clarity, audience awareness, conciseness, correctness, appropriate content and style, tone variation, goal orientation, and variety in expression.
5. **What do think might be some of the ways to make a text more formal and objective?**
   1. To make a text more formal and objective, avoid slang, contractions, prioritize precision, use third-person perspective, employ formal vocabulary, and present information objectively.
6. **Think of the last time you read something really engaging. What was so good about it?**
   1. Engaging writing captivates through compelling narrative, vivid imagery, relevance, a conversational tone, varied sentence structure, surprising ideas, emotional appeal, and clarity, creating a meaningful connection with the reader.
